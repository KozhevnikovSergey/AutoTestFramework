# AutoTestFramework

A portfolio‑style test automation framework designed to cleanly separate **test code** from **tooling code** (Appium, Selenium, Playwright, etc.), ensuring maximum flexibility and reusability.  
Switch between web and mobile platforms, different browsers, headless modes, timeouts, etc., via `config.yaml` or environment variables—no changes to test code required.

## ⚙️ Work in Progress

This project is actively being developed and is not a final version.  
Planned additions include:
- Centralized logging  
- Appium support  
- Mocking  
- Dockerfile & containerized test environment  
- CI/CD integration (tests with mocks on every PR)
